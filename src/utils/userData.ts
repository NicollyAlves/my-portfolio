  general: "I am a Software Engineering student at the Federal University of Amazonas and Full-Stack Web Development at Kenzie Academy Brazil. My main interest and affinity would be in Front-End Development. I have experience as a monitor in both Front and Backend modules and in Full-Stack team projects.",

  future: "As a current goal, I want to focus on college subjects and acquire diverse knowledge in courses that make sense to me and what I'm looking for in the future, like: something more related to user experience or something new like artificial intelligence. But these are things that I will still deepen on, seeking a better self-knowledge."
